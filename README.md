# Exploiting-IoT-Devices
The project's aim is to identify vulnerabilities in smart devices. Our focus centers on IoT devices, specifically Smart Plugs, Smart Bulbs, and Smart Cameras. We have conducted an in-depth analysis of the data packets that initiate the ON and OFF conditions in these devices.
